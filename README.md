# Move-Planner

Move Planner changes the background image, brings up news and realted links about the particular city user submitted. 
I used AJAX Request, JSON and JSONP methods to pull information from GoogleMaps, Wikipedia and NYTimes.
Created error functions in case of failure of getting data from the URL's.
Error messages cant be used for JSONP, so i used 'settimeout' method to change the text in the related container.
